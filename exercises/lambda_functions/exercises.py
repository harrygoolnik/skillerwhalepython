"""
1. HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS
-------------------------

1. Write a function called run_n_times, which can be used to call a function
   multiple times. Both the function, and the number of times to run the
   function should be received as arguments.

2. Use run_n_times to run print_hello 3 times, and display_time 10 times.

# TODO: Define the run_n_times function here.


def print_hello():
    print("Hello")


def display_time():
    print("Current Time:", datetime.datetime.now())


# TODO: Use run_n_times to call print_hello 3 times and display_time 10 times.



"""
2. BUILT-IN HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS
----------------------------------

1. Use the built-in higher order functions to complete the definitions below,
   to replace the three '...' (ellipses).

  * long_names: should be a list including all boys_names with more than 10 letters.
  * begins_with_x: should be a list of all boys_names that begin with x
  * shortest_name: should be the shortest name (or one of the shortest, in case multiple names have the same length) 
    in the boys_names list.

2. Change the `if False` to `if True` near the bottom of this section to check
   your output looks right.

"""
3. LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
-------------------

1. Use run_n_times with a lambda expression to print out "Hi There" 4 times.

2. Now, use lambda functions where appropriate to calculate the three new
   variables below (longest_name, q_names, and palindromic_names).

3. Change the `if False` near the bottom of this section to `if True` to check
   your output.
