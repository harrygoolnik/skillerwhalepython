# =============

# Write a program that finds whether a number is prime or not.
# A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
#
# The program should take a number as input and print
#   `prime` if the number is prime and `not prime` if not.
#
# It should then ask for another number.
#
# 1 is not a prime number.
# 

while True:
    number = int(input('Please input a number: '))

    # To find if a number is prime you should test
    #   whether it's divisible by any factors (other than 1 and itself).
    for factor in ...:
        ...
